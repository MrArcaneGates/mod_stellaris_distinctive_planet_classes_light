 pc_desert:0 "Desert World"
 pc_desert_desc:0 "More £energy£ energy production, less £minerals£ minerals and £food£ food. Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Precipitation and major bodies of surface water are relatively rare. Significant temperature variations between day and night cycles."
 pc_arid:0 "Arid World"
 pc_arid_desc:0 "More £energy£ generator Districs. Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce."
 pc_tundra:0 "Tundra World"
 pc_tundra_desc:0 "More £minerals£ mining districts. Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens."
 pc_continental:0 "Continental World"
 pc_continental_desc:0 "More £minerals£ minerals and £food£ food production, less £energy£ energy. Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation."
 pc_tropical:0 "Tropical World"
 pc_tropical_desc:0 "More £food£ food production, less £minerals£ minerals and £energy£ energy. Humid, rocky world with a thick nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Seasons with significant precipitation are interchanged with drier periods. Most landmasses are covered in dense vegetation."
 pc_ocean:0 "Ocean World"
 pc_ocean_desc:0 "More £food£ agriculture districts. Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a significant hydrosphere. Oceans cover more than §Y90%§! of the surface, with scattered islands making up the remaining percentage."
 pc_arctic:0 "Arctic World"
 pc_arctic_desc:0 "More £minerals£ minerals and £energy£ energy production, less £food£ food. Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation."
 pc_alpine:0 "Alpine World"
 pc_alpine_desc:1 "More £minerals£ mineral production, less £food£ food and £energy£ energy. Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops, and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation."
 pc_savannah:0 "Savanna World"
 pc_savannah_desc:1 "More £food£ food and £energy£ energy production, less £minerals£ minerals. Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses, vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases."
